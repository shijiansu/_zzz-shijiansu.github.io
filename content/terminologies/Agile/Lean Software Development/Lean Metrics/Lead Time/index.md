> #### What Is Lead Time?
>
> In Kanban, lead time is defined as the time it takes from a user story being ready for implementation to when it’s ready for delivery (release). This includes the time it’s sitting on the backlog waiting to be picked up.
>
> In terms of Kanban board columns this is the time from when a card is added to “Ready” (“To do”) to the time when you move that card to “Done”.
